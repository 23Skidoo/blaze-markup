Introduction
============

This RFC describes the problem of efficiently generating Html responses for
sending them over the network and our proposed solution called 'BlazeHtml'.
The goal of this RFC is to gather feedback from the community about its design
before publishing the first implementation.

The outline of this document is as follows. First, we define the problem we
want to solve. Then, we describe the design that we developed and prototyped at
the ZuriHac'10. Finally, we discuss further open questions not related directly
to one of the library's components.


Problem
=======

The problem we want to solve is how to efficiently generate Html responses for
sending them over the network.

The above goal is the main motivation behind our work. However, we also pursue
the following additional goals:

  * static ensurance of syntactic well-formedness

  * support for other Html-like document formats (e.g.  XHtml, XML)

  * light-weight syntax for specifying Html documents

As long as these goals don't conflict with our main goal, we try to satisfy
them as good as possible.


Proposed Solution
=================

Our solution called 'BlazeHtml' is based on a type-class 'Html' which defines
the core combinators. The instances of the 'Html' type-class correspond to
concrete output formats. We call theses instances 'Renderers'.
